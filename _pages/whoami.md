ðŸ‘‹, I'm **cloudhead**. I develop [free software][] that distributes power and
control away from central authorities, towards individual users.  Most of my
time is dedicated to [Radicle][radicle], a peer-to-peer network and sovereign
code forge; and [Bitcoin][bitcoin], for which I maintain a [light
client][nakamoto].

I've been writing software for the last two decades and have worked on almost
all areas of the software stack, though my interest lies with decentralized
systems, peer-to-peer technology and computer graphics. When I have time and need a
break from software, I also practice [art][].

Since the early 2000s, I've published a wide range of free and open source
software, including:

* **nakamoto**: a privacy-preserving Bitcoin light-client in Rust
* **rx**: a minimalist cross-platform pixel editor
* **popol**: a non-blocking I/O library for Rust
* **rgx**: a 2D bitmap graphics library for Rust
* **nonempty**: a correct-by-construction non-empty list library for Rust
* **http-console**: a simple and intuitive HTTP REPL
* **neovim-fuzzy**: a fuzzy file finder for neovim
* **avl-auth**: an authenticated AVL+ tree implementation in Haskell
* **node-static**: an rfc 2616 compliant HTTP static file server for node
* **LESS**: an attempt at a better CSS
* **hijs**: a simple and fast JavaScript syntax highlighter for the browser

You can find most of these on [GitHub][free software].

My editor of choice is [neovim][], and my primary OS is [Arch Linux][arch] with
[spectrwm][] as the window manager. You can find my dotfiles [here][dotfiles]
and my [GPG key][gpg].
