With Bitcoin Core [0.21][bitcoin] out the door offering full support for *Client
Side Filtering*,[^1] it seems like a good time to talk about the project I've
been spending my weekends on for the last six months.

*Nakamoto* is a Bitcoin light-client[^2] implementation in [Rust][rust], with
a focus on low resource utilization, modularity and privacy.

The vision for the project is to build a set of high quality and easily
embeddable libraries targeting light client wallet functionality, that can
run on any platform -- be it mobile or desktop -- while preserving user privacy.

When we take a look at the greater ecosystem, we see that it isn't uncommon for
users to end up trusting third parties when transacting. In the majority of
cases - Ethereum being a good example - it is due to poor light-client support.
This poses a considerable security and privacy risk that is counter to the
nature and *raison d'Ãªtre* of blockchains, which are designed as peer-to-peer
systems.  Light-clients are necessary for the average user to securely
interface with the network in a peer-to-peer manner, and hence the availability
of high quality implementations is paramount.

### Requirements

One of the key long-term plans for Nakamoto is to offer a C FFI, enabling
interoperation with other languages and opening up the possibility to run on
mobile devices. This could have been satisfied by writing Nakamoto in C, though
one of the project's primary goals is to offer the most secure implementation
possible.  Rust was chosen over C.

Another important consideration for mobile is *power* and *resource
efficiency*. This rules out implementations in managed languages with heavy
runtimes such as *bitcoinJ* and nudges us towards simpler designs.

Finally, user privacy is becoming increasingly important. Privacy influences
the choice of client protocols and forces us to think about how the client
interacts with the nodes on the network, and what information it reveals.

### Landscape

There are very few options out there that are satisfactory. It's fairly common
for mobile Bitcoin wallets to have a custom light-client implementation, most
of which are still based on [BIP 37][bip37].  Another common avenue is to use
something like [Electrum][electrum], which relies on non-standard Bitcoin
nodes. [Unfortunately neither of those are privacy-preserving][privacy].

Nakamoto talks directly to the Bitcoin P2P network, and thus doesn't require
special servers to connect to. For simple payment verification (SPV), the new
BIP 157 client-side block filtering protocol offers improved privacy.

Additionally, Nakamoto's client architecture enables it to run on a single
thread, minimizing CPU and memory footprint. This allows the library to
be easily embedded in any environment.

### Modularity

A lot of work has been put into building an I/O-free [protocol core][protocol].
This is the key to Nakamoto's modularity and also enables some very powerful
testing strategies that only work when the code being tested is
[deterministic][], i.e. all inputs can be controlled for.

Having a clean separation between the networking code and protocol
state-machine [reduces the possible failure states][sans-io], and
allows the networking code to be swapped based on the user's needs. If
performance is more important than efficiency or code complexity,
the included *poll*-based network [reactor][], which uses [popol](/popol) under
the hood can be swapped for one based on a thread-pool or a
thread-per-connection model.

### On Dependencies

When developing software that handles money, the security of the software is
critical. Targetted attacks on dependencies are perhaps one of the most obvious
attack vectors. One of the most important steps to prevent that is writing
software that is easy to audit. Nakamoto follows two simple principles:

1. Less code equals less bugs and less to audit
2. Less dependencies equals less moving parts and potential security risks

The second point is particularly important because dependencies are
much harder to track than code that is internal to the library. Third-party
code often ends up changing hands, and though one may trust the original
maintainer, one may not trust [whoever comes next][attacks].

These have been guiding principles from the start, and thus I've been very
economical with Nakamoto's dependency budget. Compared to other projects with a
similar scope, Nakamoto does away with a fraction of the (transitive)
dependencies.

### Closing thoughts

The project is still in its early days, though the core functionality has been
implemented and the client is able to securely synchronize the blockchain and
use compact block filters for [wallet functionality][wallet] and payment
verification.

There is a lot of work left to do before Nakamoto is ready to power the next
generation of client software on the Bitcoin and [Lightning][ln] network, so
if you're interested in peer-to-peer protocols, Rust or Bitcoin, contributions
are very welcome. If you are developing wallet software and are interested
in using Nakamoto, [get in touch][email], I'd love to help.

```rust
//! A trivial example of a client that connects to the Bitcoin
//! testnet and syncs the chain.
use std::{net, thread};

use nakamoto::client::{Client, Config, Network};
use nakamoto::client::error::Error;
use nakamoto::client::handle::Handle as _;

/// The network reactor we're going to use. This one ships with Nakamoto,
/// as part of the `nakamoto-net-poll` crate. It's a single-threaded
/// reactor using non-blocking sockets and `poll(2)`.
type Reactor = nakamoto::net::poll::Reactor<net::TcpStream>;

/// Run the light-client.
fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let cfg = Config {
        network: Network::Testnet,
        ..Config::default()
    };
    // Create a client using the above network reactor.
    let client = Client::<Reactor>::new(cfg)?;
    let handle = client.handle();

    // Run the client on a different thread, to not block the main thread.
    thread::spawn(|| client.run().unwrap());

    // Wait for the client to be in sync with the blockchain.
    handle.wait_for_ready()?;

    // The client is in sync. Ask it to shutdown.
    handle.shutdown()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

[^2]: A light-client, or SPV node is a client able to operate securely
    without access to the full blockchain. Typically, light-clients use
    only block headers to verify the chain, and thus offer a different
    security guarantee to full nodes.
